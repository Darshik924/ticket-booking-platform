/* This is the main Load test for our app that tests and proofs the ZERO overselling of tickets,  */

/*
  Goal: To prove that no matter how many users target the same seat we will have only one user who would
  successfully lock the seat and all the others would fail at locking (eg., Over here we have 1 success and 499 failures).

  In order to have 500 users target the same seat i have first registered 500 new users into the database 
  to make out work easier and then executed the load test
